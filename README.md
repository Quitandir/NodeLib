# NodeLib 

## About the project

Developed during the course "Node.js: criando sua primeira blibioteca", at Alura formation on JavaScript. The objective here is to extract and check the http status of links found in markdown texts. To do so, a .md file was given to have its external links checked, and it was necessary to apply different uses of JS to code all steps until an array of objects could be returned with the following keys: name of the link, adress, status code and status text.

## Technologies

In order to run this application, Node was used along with other packages. FileSystem modules were used to access the markdown text accessed and checked through the development of the project. Regular expression could capture in two different groups all link names and adresses, so objects could be organized into an array to be then checked by the Fetch API, returning the status of each of the links extract from the text.

## Experience 

Since I already had the opportunity to study regular expressions and the fetch API during other courses, those moments of coding were a bit easier, but extremely important to consolidate these resources. Also, I could say that I never had to use JS to implement so many differente resources for a single application, making this project specially important for me. I could then expand and integrate more possibilities regarding the use of JavaScript while trying to solve problems.
